LFU Cache implementation
Implemented a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache
system in C++
Used a combination of doubly linked lists and map
data structures
Efficiently managed key-value pairs with operations
optimized for both retrieval and storage
Handled ties in frequency using a Least Recently Used
(LRU) approach
Ensured optimal performance in cache
management
Utilized dynamic memory allocation for nodes
Managed memory efficiently through careful node
deletion and management
